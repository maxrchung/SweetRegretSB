from PIL import ImageFont

'''
Use this function to produce images out of text. Insert text into inputString, specify destination path into outputFilePath, put location of font into fontPath, and indicate what font size in fontSize. Separation is an int that determines how many characters to fit into each image. Use the Separation class for more specific options.
